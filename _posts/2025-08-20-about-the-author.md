Hi everyone, welcome to the ABC Travel Blog!
The purpose of this blog is to provide English speakers with a guide to the beautiful island of Taiwan! The focus is to be a quality blog with insights from native Taiwanese to make the most out of your Taiwan trip.
Now, why should you go to Taiwan when there’s so many other amazing destinations around East Asia? One word, convenience. Whether you decide to stay around the metropolitan areas, or go off the beaten path to explore the nature and tranquility of the countryside, everything is extremely convenient to get to with Taiwan’s plethora of transportation modes. I guarantee after you visit Taiwan, you will be fascinated by how much this tiny island actually has to offer. I hope that, even if you have the slightest interest in visiting Taiwan someday, that I am able to assist in whatever ways you need to make this a trip of a lifetime.
